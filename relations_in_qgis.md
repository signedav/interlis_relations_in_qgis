# INTERLIS Classes
![80%](assets/a_class.png)

---

## Classes
**Syntax**
```
ClassDef =  'CLASS' Class-Name '='
                { AttributeDef }
            'END' Class-Name ';'.
```
**Example**
```   
CLASS Building =
    Name : TEXT*20;
    Nr_of_Floors : MANDATORY 1 .. 100;
END Building;
```
---
## Structures
**Syntax**
```
StructureDef =  'STRUCTURE' Struct-Name '='
                    { AttributeDef }
                'END' Struct-Name ';'.
```
**Example**
```
STRUCTURE Address =
    StreetName : TEXT*40;
    Number : TEXT*12;
END Address;
```
---
## Types of classes
- Concrete
- Abstract
- Final
- Derivate/Extended
---
## Concrete Classes
```
CLASS Building =
    Name : TEXT*20;
    Nr_of_Floors : MANDATORY 1 .. 100;
END Building;

CLASS Office_Building
    EXTENDS Building =
    Nr_of_Companies : MANDATORY 1 .. 200;
END CLASS Office_Building;
```
---

## Abstract Classes
```
CLASS Building (ABSTRACT) =
    Name : TEXT*20;
    Nr_of_Floors : MANDATORY 1 .. 100;
END Building;

CLASS Office_Building
    EXTENDS Building =
    Nr_of_Companies : MANDATORY 1 .. 200;
END CLASS Office_Building;
```
---

## Final Classes
```
CLASS Building (FINAL) =
    Name : TEXT*20;
    Nr_of_Floors : MANDATORY 1 .. 100;
END Building;

CLASS Office_Building
    EXTENDS Building =
    Nr_of_Companies : MANDATORY 1 .. 200;
END CLASS Office_Building;
```
```
!! Error: Building cannot be extended
```
---
## Extending Structures
```
STRUCTURE AddressBase (ABSTRACT) =
    StreetName : TEXT*40;
    Number : TEXT*12;
END AddressBase;

CLASS Address
    EXTENDS AddressBase =
    PLZ : TEXT*6;
    Remarks : TEXT;
END CLASS Address;
```

# INTERLIS Associations
![80%](assets/an_association.png)

---

## Cardinality

### one-to-many
A building belongs to **exactly one** parcel. A parcel **can** have **multiple** buildings.

```
ASSOCIATION =
    local_buildings -- {0..*} Building;
    parcel -- {1} Parcel;
END;
```
### many-to-many
A parcel is owned by **at least one** person. A person **can** own parts of **multiple** parcels.

```
ASSOCIATION Property =
    Person -- {1..*} Person;
    Parcel -- {0..*} Parcel;
END;
```
---

## Strength
- Association `--`: Relationship between independent objects. 
- Aggregation `-<>`: Relationship between parts and a whole. A part can be part of multiple wholes.
- Composition `-<#>`: Relationship between parts and a whole. A part can only be part of a single whole.

<!-- **aggregation** all ascribed parts are automatically copied when copying the entity, however when
deleting the entity the corresponding parts **remain untouched**. Compared to an aggregation you will
find that a **composition** further implies, that when deleting the entity **all parts are deleted** at the
same time.-->
---

## Attributes
An association can contain attributes as well.
```
ASSOCIATION Property =
    Person -- {1..*} Person;
    Parcel -- {0..*} Parcel;
    Ownership_Share : 0 .. 100;
END;
```
---
## Structures

```
STRUCTURE Address =
    StreetName : TEXT*40;
    Number : TEXT*12;
END Address;

CLASS Building =
    Position : Address;
END Building;
```
Possible to use with `LIST` or `BAG .. OF`
```
CLASS Building =
    Position : BAG {0..*} OF Address;
END Building;
```
---

## Cross Topic Associations (1)
A topic that references a class from another topic must have a dependency on the other topic. In the association, one has to use the keyword "EXTERNAL".
```
  TOPIC Parcel =
    DEPENDS ON Building_Parcel_Property.Person;

    ASSOCIATION Property =
      Person (EXTERNAL) -- {1..*} Building_Parcel_Property.Person.Person;
      Parcel -- {0..*} Parcel;
      property_type : MANDATORY Building_Parcel_Property.Property_Type;
      ownership_share : MANDATORY 0 .. 100 [Units.Percent];
    END Property;
```

---

## Cross Topic Associations (2)
Cross topic associations in UML-Editor:

---

# Example Model [`Building_Parcel_Property`](./model/building_parcel_property.ili)

![](./assets/building_parcel_property_ER-Diagramm.png)

<!-- Go through the ili model -->
---

# Let's have a look in QGIS
- ili2db creates the physical Database
- QGIS Model Baker generates the project

---
# UsabILIty Hub
The idea of the UsabILItyHub is to receive meta data like ili2db settings, layer styles and orders etc. automatically over the web. 

Like we can now receive models by connecting the ilimodels.xml of http://models.interlis.ch and with it's ilisite.xml many other repositories, we will be able to get this meta data with the file ilidata.xml on the UsabILItyHub usabilityhub.opengis.ch

# Inheritance mapping
- New Class
- Super Class
- Sub Class
- New+Sub Class

---

## Sample Model

![bg right 80%](./assets/sample_model.png)

<!-- Mention that Parking is not Parcel -->

---
## New Class (1)

![bg right 80%](./assets/new_class_surreal.png)

---
## New Class (2)
```
Building.t_type: (
    Residental_Building,
    Office_Building,
    Public_Office_Building
)
```
- Specializations are mapped as associations
- Multiple inserts and updates required per object
- Not null attributes can be setted

![bg right 80%](./assets/new_class.png)

---

## Sample Model

![bg right 80%](./assets/sample_model.png)---

---

## Super Class
```
Building.t_type: (
    Residental_Building,
    Office_Building,
    Public_Office_Building
)
```
- Missing not null constraints
- Less tables and associations (easy to use)

![bg right 80%](./assets/super_class.png)

---

## Sample Model

![bg right 80%](./assets/sample_model.png)

---

## Sub Class
```
Public_Office_Building.t_type: (
    Office_Building,
    Public_Office_Building
)
```
- Missing not null constraints

![bg right 80%](./assets/sub_class.png)

---

## Sample Model

![bg right 80%](./assets/sample_model.png)

---

## New + Sub Class
- IMO the expected behavior
- Missing not null constraints

![bg right 80%](./assets/new_sub_class.png)

# Smart Mapping in ili2db

---

## noSmartMapping

- All classes are mapped using *New Class* strategy

<!-- Maybe graphic how it looks like -->
---

## noSmartMapping

Results in what we see in *New Class* graphic.

![bg right 80%](./assets/new_class.png)

---

## smart1Inheritance

- Abstract classes without associations -> *Sub Class* strategy
- Abstract classes with associations and no concrete super class -> *New Class* strategy
- Concrete classes without concrete super class -> *New Class* strategy
- All other classes -> *Super Class* strategy

---

## smart1Inheritance

Means in our example the `Building` uses *New Class* and all others *Super Class* strategy. This results in what we see in the *Super Class* graphic.

![bg right 80%](./assets/super_class.png)

---

## smart2Inheritance
-  Abstract classes -> *Sub Class* strategy
-  All concrete classes  -> *New + Sub Class* strategy

---

## smart2Inheritance
Means in our example the `Building` uses *Sub Class* and all other *New+Sub Class*. This results in what we see in the *New+Sub Class* graphic.

# Relations in QGIS

## Relation Management in QGIS
-  Relations can be added or removed in menu "Project" --> "Properties" --> "Relations".
-  QGIS ModelBaker generates the relations automatically from you, derived from the Interlis model (through ili2pg)
-  Unfortunately, already existing relations cannot be change anymore (e.g. changing the strength)

![](./assets/relation_manager_qgis.png)

---

## Relation Management in QGIS
QGIS offers the followin widgets suitable for managing related classes
-  "Relation Reference" Widget (combobox), suitable for n:1 (or 1:1) relations.
    -  Example: Building matches exactly one parcel.
-  "Value Relation" Widget (combobox), suitable for domains with key/value columns and a description shown with tooltips.
    -  Example: security level of an office building.
- "Relation" Widget (nested embedded form from related table), suitable for 1:n and n:m relations.
    -  Example: One parcel links to many buildings (1:n)
    -  Example: a parcel has multiple owners (n:m), an owner can own multiple parcels.

---

### Relation Reference Widget (1) - Look and Feel
-  For 0..1:n or 1:1 relations
-  Allows to select related features with a combobox displaying an expression with a combination of one or more attributes
-  Choice of related object can be done either with combobox or by clicking a related object on the map
-  Optionally allows to create a new related feature
-  Optionally displays the form of the related feature, either embedded or in a separate window

![](./assets/relation_reference_widget_1.png)

---

### Relation Reference Widget (2) - Configuration

![](./assets/relation_reference_widget_2_configuration.png)

---

### Relation Reference Widget (3) - Known issues
-  Picking elements on map only works for top-level forms and not for nested forms ;-(

---

### Value Relation Widget (1) - Look and Feel
-  For selecting domain values
-  With key/value pairs
-  Optionally display a description of the value in a tooltip

![](./assets/value_relation_widget_1.png)

---

### Value Relation Widget (2) - Configuration

![](./assets/value_relation_widget_2_configuration.png)

---

### Relation Widget (1) - Look and Feel
-  For 1:n and n:m relations
-  With embedded form and side list panel to step through related objects
-  for n:m relations the in between table can be hidden if there are no attributes on the association

![](./assets/relation_widget_1.png)

---

### Relation Widget (2) - Configuration

![](./assets/relation_widget_2_configuration.png)

---

### Relation Widget (3) - Link/unlink vs Add/Remove/Duplicate
-  Link and Unlink better suited for "Associations" (low strength)
-  Add/Remove/Duplicate better suited for "Aggregations" and "Compositions" (higher strength)

---

### Relation Widget (4) - Cardinality
-  For 1:n relations: choose "Many to one relation"
-  For n:m relations: choose "Class Name (Primary Key)", e.g. "Person (t_id)" on both ends of the relation to hide the in-between table

---

### Relation Widget (5) - Known issues
-  Update issues in side list panel when data changes in a child form
-  Multiple nested forms (xx-levels deep)

---

## Cascading Deletion of related objects

### Cascading Deletion in QGIS
-  For Aggregation and Compositions: QGIS asks if you want to deletes related objects 
-  For Assocations you have to first unlink related objects before removing and object that contains references
-  Referenced structures: treated like Assocations, you also manually need to unlink objects first

![](./assets/cascading_delete_qgis.png)


---

### Cascading Deletion in Postgis
-  use ON UPDATE and ON DELETE rules
-  Possible values: "RESTRICT", "NO ACTION", "SET NULL", "SET DEFAULT" and "CASCADE"

```
ALTER TABLE building_parcel_property_smart2.heating
DROP CONSTRAINT heating_office_building_heating_fkey;

ALTER TABLE building_parcel_property_smart2.heating
  ADD CONSTRAINT heating_office_building_heating_fkey FOREIGN KEY (office_building_heating)
 REFERENCES building_parcel_property_smart2.office_building(t_id) 
 ON UPDATE RESTRICT ON DELETE CASCADE
 DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED;

```
